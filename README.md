# About The App

[React Authentication]

Many web applications are a mix of public and private pages. Public pages are available to anyone, while a private page requires a user login. You can use authentication to manage which users have access to which pages. Your React application will need to handle situations where a user tries to access a private page before they are logged in, and you will need to save the login information once they have successfully authenticated.
